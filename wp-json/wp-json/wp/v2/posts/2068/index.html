However, you can keep the iPhone 14 Pro Maxs display free of fingerprints and reflections by using a matte glass screen protector. Even if the screen of the iPhone 14 is reinforced with ceramic shield, it may still get affected and scratched from sand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, the iPhone 14s display screen is still made from glass, and that can still get scratched by solid objects. The ceramic shield is made from material that is much harder to scratch than most metals. Ceramic Shield is unique to Apple smartphones, first introduced in the iPhone 12, promising more durable glass that will protect from knocks and falls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Apple, Ceramic Shield in the iPhone 14 Series The iPhone 14 Series is stronger than any other smartphone glass on the market, protecting the device against spills and daily accidents. The iPhone 14 Pro uses a special kind of protective glass that Apple calls Ceramic Shield, which it says offers scratch resistance and a four-times increase in drop protection over non-Apple special glass iPhone models. This Spigen protector is rated at 9H hardness, its transparent material retains Apples iPhone 14 Pros original screen brightness and clarity, and to add insult to injury, it is also fingerprint resistant thanks to an Oleophobic coating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This Spigen protector is one of the best screen protectors for this phone, as in addition to being 5X stronger, it filters out blue light for eyes protection, and is simple to install. Cornings Gorilla Glass is good at things like dropping, and keeping your iPhone from getting scuffed up from keys in the pocket, but it can still get bypassed with too much force, and scratches caused by things like sand and gravel, so a screen protector really makes sense here. If you really get a case for the iPhone 14, be sure that it is slim and lightweight; easily put on and take off; has an raised lip around the iPhone 14s glass screen (to prevent it directly touching surfaces); and has good grip, so that you can grab hold of your new iPhone 14 without dropping it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could go with a clear case on the phone, so that you can still admire the new iPhone that you bought, along with a glass tempered screen protector that will keep the screen safe from scratches and scratches, and a warranty that covers a 1-time free screen replacement (the screen is from the original manufacturer) all in one. Looking directly at the screen, you still get to enjoy a gorgeous display with bright colors, excellent clarity, and complete Face-ID functionality thanks to high-quality glass and a privacy filter.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you are using the iPhone 14 Pro Max with the case on, then you do not need to worry, because that protector leaves some<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2143,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[34],"tags":[46],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2068"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2068"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2068\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2123,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2068\/revisions\/2123"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2143"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2068"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2068"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2068"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
