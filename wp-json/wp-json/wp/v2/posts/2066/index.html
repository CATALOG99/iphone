By adding SOS via satellite to its latest iPhones, Apple is taking what was a niche security feature and offering it to millions of iPhone 14 owners. Apple is rolling out a new feature that allows its latest iPhones to communicate with low-Earth orbiting satellites and transmit information back to the teams of emergency responders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple built a new interface that lets users send messages to emergency services via satellite using a questionnaire that asks key questions to help first responders understand an emergency situation and dispatch assistance. Apple has built a new interface that allows users to send messages to emergency services over satellite using a questionnaire that asks critical questions for first responders to understand the emergency and dispatch help. Well, just like its name suggests, this feature allows you to tap into satellite and send a distress message to either emergency services providers or an Apple Relay Center, who will be able to call on your behalf to get assistance. Apple launched its emergency service through satellite feature back on November 15, 2022. At the time of its release, the emergency service through satellite feature was available only in the United States and Canada, but since December 14, France, Germany, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. At this point, Apples Emergency Service Through Satellite feature is available only in the United States, and as of December 14, France, Germany, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. At this point, Apples emergency through satellite function is only available in the United States, and Canada. Well, let us find out.Well, just as the name implies, when you do not have reception, the feature lets you connect to a satellite and send an SOS message to an emergency services provider or an Apple relay center, which can call for assistance on your behalf.Apple launched the Emergency SOS via satellite feature on November 15th, 2022.At launch, the Emergency SOS via satellite feature was only available in the US and Canada, but as of December 14th, it is also available in France, Germany, Ireland, and the UK.Currently, only the latest iPhone 14 lineup supports Apples Emergency SOS via satellite feature. As noted above, it is unfortunately missing those purchased on the Chinese mainland, in Hong Kong, or in Macao.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, if the phone does not have the service, it gives you a heads-up that you can still use it to dial 911, either showing text such as Emergency Call Only, or, in the case of iOS 16, a badge. It turns out SOS on the status bar is the way that Apple is now signaling that a phone is not connected to the cell network, but it is still capable of making 911 calls. If your iPhone is not properly connected to a cellular network, you will be able to find SOS, or simply an SOS, at the upper-right corner on iOS 16, or at the upper-left corner on iOS 15 and below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, an SOS icon means the iPhone is out of range of your carrier, but does not disable 911 calls. The SOS icon, or text with only the letters SOS, that typically appears on the upper-right of the iPhone in iOS 16, or upper-left in earlier versions, indicates there is an issue with the cell networks. You are guided through to the satellite-connection stage after answering emergency questions and are ready to send your compressed, encrypted, message.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are then guided into holding your iPhone 14 down in order to make the connection with a visible satellite above your head, and to get the message through to the emergency response team. You get the same hand-held satellite-positioning bits that are in the emergency part, and Apple will then show you the message has been sent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Months after its announcement at Septembers event, Apples satellite-based emergency notification service, which uses satellites to route emergency calls to the iPhone 14 and iPhone<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2140,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[34],"tags":[44],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2066"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2066"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2066\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2121,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2066\/revisions\/2121"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2140"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2066"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2066"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2066"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
