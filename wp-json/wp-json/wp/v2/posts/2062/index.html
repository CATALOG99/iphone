You can&#8217;t use Siri, but you can listen and talk. To set up your AirPods&nbsp;with an Android phone or other non-Apple device,<sup>3<\/sup>&nbsp;follow these steps:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"has-luminous-vivid-amber-background-color has-background\">\n<li>On your non-Apple device, go to the settings for Bluetooth and make sure that Bluetooth is on.<sup>4<\/sup>&nbsp;If you have an Android device, go to Settings &gt; Connections &gt; Bluetooth.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>With your&nbsp;AirPods in the charging case, open the lid.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Press and hold the setup button on the back of the case until the status light flashes white.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>When your&nbsp;AirPods appear in the list of Bluetooth devices, select them.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you paired AirPods Pro with an iPhone, and you want to now switch to a different phone, you will need to press the pairing button on the charging cover and follow the on-screen instructions. With the cases still open, position AirPods or AirPods Pro next to an iPhone or iPad, and follow the instructions on-screen to pair. For the AirPods and AirPods Pro, open the case, hold them next to an Android device, tap the white button on the back until a list of connected devices appears on your screen, then tap Connect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apples AirPods Pro is connected to an Android phone, enable Bluetooth on an iPhone\/iPad, and find the device, then tap on the AirPods Pro to connect to an iOS device. If Apples AirPods are not automatically connected to your Android device, you can go to the apps settings and turn on the &#8220;Autoconnect&#8221; option. Now, you can open the Bluetooth menu on another device, look for the listing for the AirPods Pro, and connect the AirPods Pro.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your AirPods should then appear in the &#8220;Add device&#8221; window of the PCs Bluetooth settings, where you can tap pairing and connecting. The next time you want to connect, search your AirPods on your list of Bluetooth devices that are available, and tap Connect if it does not automatically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look for your AirPods in your Bluetooth settings and check that they are connected: If they are not, open your AirPods casing and select your AirPods from the Bluetooth section to connect. If you have several Bluetooth headphones, speakers, and other audio devices, your iPhone may want to connect automatically with several Bluetooth headphones before the AirPods. You are not limited to Apple-made gadgets; thanks to the power of Bluetooth, the AirPods can connect with Android devices, as well as your PC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the dedicated chip inside its charging case, connecting the AirPods with an iPhone or iPad is a breeze: just pop open the case next to your AirPods, then tap Connect. Simply press and hold the rear button of the charging case while it is open with the AirPods inside to start the pairing process. To pair AirPods, turn on Bluetooth on an iOS device by opening Control Center, and then tapping the Bluetooth icon to turn on Bluetooth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After making an initial connection between the Windows 10 PC and Apple AirPods, you can re-connect your AirPods and the Windows 10 PC for listening to music, watching YouTube, video conferencing, and more by going back to the Bluetooth and Other Devices page under Settings. If audio does not immediately sound like it should, you might have to click either the Volume Control or Bluetooth menus on your menu bar, and ensure Apple AirPods has been set up as an output device.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Use AirPods with a non-Apple device You can use&nbsp;AirPods as a Bluetooth headset with a non-Apple device.
