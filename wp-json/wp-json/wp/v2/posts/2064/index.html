The first thing you will want to do is enable the screen recording feature on your device, you can do that in the Settings menu of your iPhone or iPad. If you are using an iPhone or iPad and are wondering how to record the screen, the process may not be that obvious.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is one relatively simple method for recording your face and screen simultaneously, if that is something that interests you. If you would prefer to take a video record of the Apple iPhones screen rather than a static screenshot, that is also something you can do. If you would like to take video of the screen of an iPhone or iPad, you do not have to even download an app to accomplish this task.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are an iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch owner, there is no longer any need to use a ton of apps to capture the screens on your devices. This makes it a lot easier than going through third-party apps to record the activities on your iPhone or iPads screen. Now that you know this neat hack to capture the screen on an iPhone, it is also something that can be used on an Apple iPad device.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is really useful functionality if you are looking to record a quick video on how to do something on an iPhone or iPad, or you are looking to record your gaming skills, etc. You might want to do more with your recordings than is typically available on an iPhone. Fortunately, there are other screen recorder apps that work with the iPhone that offer far more advanced features, such as the iPhone screen recording app Screencast-o-matic, which lets you record your screen, add comments, edit your recordings, and easily share the recordings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding subtitling and captions to your iPhone screen recordings using the free app means that you can be sure you are hitting the mark accessibility-wise. The iPhones native screen recording tools come with limited features, one being that while you can screen record and include subtitling or captioning, you cannot edit it. Along with all of the features and benefits discussed above, the free application is continually updated in order to deliver an improved product to users who use the service, as well as more features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Screencast-O-Matics screen recording app for iPhone makes screen recording incredibly simple, so you can make &#8220;how-to&#8221; videos, product demonstrations, or even just fun moments to share with friends. With the iPhones screen recorder features, you can keep favorite YouTube clips, make tutorials for your friends, or even record gameplay sequences in a few taps. Once you have downloaded Record It!, take the following steps to make sure that your Recorder is readily available from the Control panel of your iPhone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the Recording function is not already under a section called &#8220;Included controls,&#8221; swipe down to &#8220;More controls&#8221; and tap the green plus sign next to it. To access Record, swipe down from the upper right side of your screen, which brings up your Control Center. If you have an iPhone X or higher, swipe from the top right corner down to access the Control Center, and tap on the gray Record button on the bottom of the screen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have the iPhone 8, SE, or older, swipe upwards from the bottom of the screen, and then tap on the Record. If you do not want a screen recording button in Control Center anymore, you can easily remove the screen recording button by returning to Controls, then tapping on the red &#8212; sign. If you wish to turn off the sound, just hold the record button again and tap the mic symbol again to turn it off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do not want to use the microphone, you can turn it off by returning to the pop-up and clicking the microphone icon. The grey record button will also record your voice if you enable the mic feature (to access it, press and hold the Record button to bring up a pop-up menu). To begin using recording, just tap on the record icon, which starts a three-second countdown timer to get you into what you want to record.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To begin, navigate to an app or website that you would like to record, so that when recording starts, there are less steps you need to perform. You will know that you are still recording because the time shown on the top-left corner will be red. A countdown timer of three seconds will show up, then the clock at the top left corner of your screen will be turned red.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the phone is recording, the screen will display a red record icon, or alert, at the upper right. Once recording has started, you will see a red symbol appear in the upper-right corner, which indicates your iPhones screen is being recorded. Once the recording is complete, the alert will inform you that a video has been recorded and stored in the devices Photo Album.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, recordings are saved in your Photos album, but you can select another destination from a list provided when you press the Record button for longer. If you wish to record both the screen and audio, long-press the Screen Recording icon, click on the microphone audio icon to enable, tap Start recording, wait 3 seconds, and your screen recording will start. Taking a screenshot &#8212; a single, static picture of the screen of your device, whether that is your iPhone, a Mac or your Apple Watch &#8212; is easy enough.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How to record your screen Go to&nbsp;the Photos app&nbsp;and select your screen recording.
