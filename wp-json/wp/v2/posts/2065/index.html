If you wish to reset the iPhone back to the factory state, click on the &#8220;Erase All Content and Settings&#8221; option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another route you can take for resetting your iPhone is through the Settings menu on the phone itself, provided that you can navigate beyond the Home screen. If you are experiencing issues on an iPhone, such as your iPhone freezing or malfunctioning, then returning your device to the factory settings can fix the problem. You can perform the restore straight from your iPhone, without the need for iTunes, but this process is not available if your phone is turned off or stuck in recovery mode.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you can place your iPhone into DFU mode, attach it to iTunes, choose &#8220;Restore,&#8221; and your phone is fully restored.

If you really want to turn off your iPhone 14, you can do that by going into the General section of the Settings app, scrolling to the bottom, and selecting the Power Off option. A total wipe is something of a nuclear option, however, so before going this route, you would want to consider rebooting or forcing your iPhone or iPad into recovery mode, since those will keep your data and settings intact.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Use Settings to erase iPhone Factory Resets erase all your personal information, returning your iPhone to the original factory settings.
