Place your AirPods in pairing mode by opening their charging case and placing them next to the Mac.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do not have your iPhone handy, you can place them back into the charging case with the cover opened. If your AirPods are already connected to an iPhone, you should be able to select the AirPods from the volume icons on the menu bar. If your AirPods or AirPods Pro are paired, but are not connected, you can tap on the Volume Control button in the menu bar, and choose your headphones to switch between them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you chose to add Bluetooth to the menu bar, you can tap that icon at any time to check your AirPods battery life and toggle modes with AirPods Pro. To check, put Apples AirPods (2017) into your ears, then look at the drop-down menu for either Bluetooth or Volume in your Macs menu bar. If you are still hearing audio coming through their MacBooks speakers, choose either the Bluetooth or volume controls in the menu bar, and make sure that either the AirPods or the AirPods Pro are selected as your output device.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your AirPods are connected to the same Apple ID as your MacBook, and are set up via your iPhone already, open the cover on the enclosure closest to the MacBook. Your AirPods are designed to connect to your Mac automatically as long as your Mac uses the same Apple ID as your iPhone. Using AirBuddy ($5.00), you can view your AirPods or AirPods Pros connectivity status by opening the devices charging case next to your Mac.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the event that you paired the AirPods Pro to an iPhone, and you want to now switch to a different phone, you will need to hold down the pairing button on the charging case and follow the on-screen instructions. If you would prefer to keep the pairing process closer to how you would do on iPhone or iPad &#8212; usually, you will not need to press a button, either &#8212; then you can use a third-party app to achieve a similar iPhone-like experience for AirPods or AirPods Pro on a Mac. If your AirPods are not doing this (if, say, they are pairing with an iPhone instead), just tap the Bluetooth icon on the Macs menu bar, choose your AirPods from the drop-down list, and click Connect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you paired your AirPods to an iPhone, and your Mac is signed into the same iCloud account as your iPhone, place your AirPods in your ears and open the Bluetooth app on your Mac, clicking the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar, clicking on the name you gave your AirPods, and choosing Connect<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;ve set up your AirPods with your iPhone and your Mac is signed in to iCloud with the same Apple ID, your AirPods&nbsp;may be<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2103,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[35],"tags":[39],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2061"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2061"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2061\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2105,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2061\/revisions\/2105"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2103"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2061"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2061"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2061"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
