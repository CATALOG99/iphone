For instance, Alexa, OK Google, Bixby, and so on Siri is the default virtual assistant on Apple devices, whether iPhone 14, iPad 12, and so on If you are really using iOS devices, then find out how to setup and use Siri on the iPhone 14. Siri first appeared on iPhone 4S, but Siri is also available on iPad, iPod touch, Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, and the Mac (macOS Sierra and higher) &#8212; see our guide on Siri on macOS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article covers how to enable and access Siri on iPhone 12, what you can do with Siri, and how to use an Intercom-like mode. We hope that this article on iPhone 14 helps you out and solves all of your problems. Once you have enabled Siri in your iPhone 12, all you have to do is either say Hey Siri or long-press on the right-hand side button to get to Siri.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have enabled Hey Siri, you can just say Hey Siri aloud next to your iPhone 14 to activate it. If you would like to use Hey Siri when the iPhone is face-down or covered, head into Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Siri and turn on Always Listen For Hey Siri option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you select the second option while turning on your Virtual Assistant on your iPhone 14, which is the side-button pressed option for Siri, you can hold the power button and Siri will begin talking to you. Another way of activating Siri on the iPhone 13 smartphone is by pressing and holding the side button on your iPhone 13, then Siri will open.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the iPhone or iPad, Siri can be activated either by holding down the Home key on compatible models, or holding down the Side button on devices that do not have a home key. Most Apple devices support the command to trigger Siri with the command Hey, Siri, but newer iPads, iPhones, Macs, and Apple Watches provide hands-free Siri support with the command Hey, Siri, even when disconnected from power.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The minute you unplug your iPhone 6 or older, you cannot use just your voice to activate Hey Siri. In addition to the neat feature of Hey Siri, which lets you call Siri simply by calling out to it, even when the device is asleep, you can still physically activate Siri on Face ID models by holding down the large side button for two to three seconds. Now, to turn Siri suggestions on or off from either the lock screen or within apps, head into the Siri and search screen, scroll down and choose your desired app, and select the desired toggle to toggle Siri suggestions on or off.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Activate Siri with a button When you activate Siri with a button, Siri responds silently when iPhone is in&nbsp;silent mode.
