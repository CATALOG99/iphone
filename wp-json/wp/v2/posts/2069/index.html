Whether you choose a standard iPhone 14 Pro or a Pro Max, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro is available in one colour, the new Deep Purple, Gold, Silver, and Space Black. There is also a new 48-megapixel main camera, an enormous bump in pixels which may well make the 14 Pro the best iPhone to take pictures with in 2022 &#8212; and the handset is available in the new, subtle colour Deep Purple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In comparison, the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max models receive a far darker hue, which Apple calls the Deep Purple. Space Black, Silver, and Gold are all long-standing classics in iPhone color history, whereas Deep Purple (and purple, generally) is the newest hue that Apple is including in Apples iPhone line. We have seen another version of Deep Purple trim in past iPhones, but the new iPhone looks slightly different thanks to its matte back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new shade of Deep Purple was one of the most requested colors in the iPhone 14 lineup, with Apple picking it up again in 2022. Apple has been playing around with shades of their signature Red in recent years, and now we have a brighter, lighter Red color that stands out more, though some people would still revert to the Red of the iPhone 8s for a better hue &#8212; including me. The gold iPhone 14 Pro trim looks identical to previous Gold versions, but Matthew Panzarino at TechCrunch says that the Silver color looks noticeably better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some pictures of white\/silver, and also of what the Space Black looks like when compared with the graphite color on the iPhone 13 Pro, courtesy of Panzarino. Some interesting colourways, though, do not appear the same as what you will receive with the new iPhone, so make sure you check those out too before making your purchasing decision. Silver is a color that needs little introduction &#8212; silver is one Apple has offered in the past &#8212; including in the iPhone 13 Pro lineup &#8212; and it is one other handset makers also frequently sell their devices in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shade below, Space Black &#8211; despite its name &#8211; is more a very dark gray than black, falling between the graphite shades that Apple sells phones in at times, and the midnight shades that you might be getting an iPhone 13. The iPhone 14 and the iPhone 14 Pro families come with varying colour options, so if you are firmly set on a specific hue, you might not get the model you prefer in that colour.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Deep Purple is best color for iphone 14 pro If you are buying an iPhone 14 Pro or an iPhone 14 Pro Max, you have<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2144,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[34],"tags":[47],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2069"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2069"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2069\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2137,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2069\/revisions\/2137"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2144"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2069"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2069"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2069"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
